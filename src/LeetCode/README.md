[**1. Two Sum**](P1_TwoSum.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

[**2. Maximum Subarray**](P2_MaxSubArray.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],

Output: 6

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

[**3. Maximum Product Subarray**](P3_MaxProductSubArray.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

[**4. Valid Parentheses**](P4_ValidParenthesis.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: "([)]"
Output: false

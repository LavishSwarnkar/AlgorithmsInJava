[**1. Two Sum**](P1_TwoSum.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

[**2. Maximum Subarray**](P2_MaxSubArray.java)
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],

Output: 6

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
